# Providers

A **provider** is a target AI-coding tool that graft reads from and writes to. Each provider has its own file layout and schema; graft hides those differences behind one interface.

## What graft supports

graft targets **eight active** providers, defined in the frozen `Provider` contract (`internal/contract`), plus one planned (`antigravity`) and one deprecated (`gemini-cli`):

| Provider id | Tool | Active |
|-------------|------|--------|
| `claude-code` | Claude Code | Yes |
| `codex` | Codex | Yes |
| `cursor` | Cursor | Yes |
| `github-copilot` | GitHub Copilot | Yes |
| `opencode` | OpenCode | Yes |
| `roo-code` | Roo Code | Yes |
| `goose` | Goose | Yes |
| `grok-cli` | Grok CLI | Yes |

## What a provider does

Every provider implements the same interface:

- **Detect** — find this provider's agent files under the workspace root.
- **Parse** — read one provider file into a provider-shaped form.
- **ToCanonical** — map a parsed provider agent into the neutral canonical form, preserving non-canonical fields under `providerOverrides`.
- **Serialize** — render a canonical agent into this provider's file(s), restoring stashed overrides.
- **Schema** — return the provider's JSON Schema for validation.

Because every provider speaks this one interface, the sync engine and transform registry treat them uniformly.

## providerOverrides

Providers carry settings that have no neutral home in the canonical model. These are stored under `providerOverrides[<provider>]` in `agent.yaml` and restored verbatim when serializing back to that provider.

### Schema binding

`providerOverrides` is **schema-bound per provider** in the canonical JSON Schema (`internal/canonical/schema/common-agent-definition.schema.json`):

- The top-level `providerOverrides` object uses `additionalProperties: false`, so only the registered provider ids are accepted as keys. An unknown key (typo or unregistered provider) causes a validation error — editors with JSON Schema support will underline it immediately.
- Each `providerOverrides[<provider>]` value is validated against the definition for that provider (`$defs/po-<provider>`). This means editors will offer completion and type-check the fields you set per provider.
- The `$id` of the schema is the public raw GitHub URL:
  ```
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shaik-Sirajuddin/graft/main/internal/canonical/schema/common-agent-definition.schema.json
  ```
  Point your editor's JSON Schema association at this URL for live validation.

### Rules

- `name` is **never** overridable via `providerOverrides` — it is the agent's identity and is enforced at the serialization layer. The schema omits `name` from every `po-<provider>` definition.
- An unknown provider key under `providerOverrides` is an **error** (blocks sync). graft uses Levenshtein distance to suggest the nearest valid provider id.
- Override values are validated against the provider's schema. Unrecognized fields produce a **warning** (never blocking) because catalog schemas may be incomplete.

### Per-provider tool override

Each `po-<provider>` schema includes a `tools` field. You can override the tool list for a single provider without changing the canonical `tools`:

```yaml
# .graft/agents/reviewer/agent.yaml
name: reviewer
description: Reviews diffs for correctness and style.
tools:
  - read_file
  - grep
providerOverrides:
  claude-code:
    tools:
      - Read           # native claude-code name
      - Grep
      - WebSearch
  opencode:
    tools:
      - read
      - grep
      - websearch
```

The canonical `tools` field uses canonical names (see [Tool names and canonicalization](#tool-names-and-canonicalization) below). Provider tool overrides use the provider's **native** tool names — the schema for each provider enumerates the accepted values plus a wildcard pattern (`*`, `mcp_*`, `mcp__server__tool`, `Agent(...)`).

## Tool names and canonicalization

graft stores **canonical tool names** in `agent.yaml` using a `lowercase_snake_case` taxonomy. On sync, graft translates each canonical name into the native spelling for each provider:

| Canonical | Claude Code | Gemini CLI | OpenCode | Codex |
|-----------|-------------|------------|----------|-------|
| `web_search` | `WebSearch` | `google_web_search` | `websearch` | `web_search` |
| `read_file` | `Read` | `read_file` | `read` | — |
| `bash` | `Bash` | `run_shell_command` | `bash` | `shell` |
| `glob` | `Glob` | `glob` | `glob` | — |
| `grep` | `Grep` | `search_file_content` | `grep` | — |
| `web_fetch` | `WebFetch` | `web_fetch` | `webfetch` | — |
| `file_edit` | `Edit` | `edit` + `replace` | `edit` | — |
| `file_write` | `Write` | `write_file` | — | — |

The full taxonomy is in `internal/catalog/data/canonical-tools.md`. Use canonical names in the top-level `tools` field of `agent.yaml`. Use native names only inside `providerOverrides[<provider>].tools`.

The canonical `tools` array is validated against an enumerated set in the JSON Schema, so editors flag unrecognized canonical names. Wildcards (`*`), MCP patterns (`mcp_*`, `mcp__server__tool`), and `Agent(...)` pass through and are never rejected by the enum.

## Enabling a subset

You do not have to sync all providers. `providers.mode` and `providers.enabled[]` / `providers.disabled[]` control which providers participate. See [Config reference](../reference/config.md).

## Planned

A **planned** provider has not yet been built into the sync engine — it is present in the embedded catalog only and will be wired up in a future release.

| Provider id | Tool | Status |
|-------------|------|--------|
| `antigravity` | Antigravity | Planned — catalog only, unregistered, pending research spike |

:::note antigravity
antigravity has a catalog entry (schema, models, capabilities) but is currently **not registered** in the sync engine. The agent-definition format and home-scope paths need a research spike before it can be wired up. Until then it is excluded from `graft sync`, `graft agent`, and provider-count summaries. It will be re-registered once the format is confirmed.
:::

## Deprecated

A **deprecated** provider was previously active but has been removed from the active set. Its code and catalog entry are kept for reference; it should not be used.

| Provider id | Tool | Status |
|-------------|------|--------|
| `gemini-cli` | Gemini CLI | Deprecated — previously supported, removed from the active set (2026-06-15) |

:::note gemini-cli
gemini-cli was previously a supported, active provider but is **deprecated** as of 2026-06-15: it has been removed from the active set (unregistered from the sync and skills engines). Its code and catalog entry (schema, models, capabilities) are kept as reference, and the catalog marks it `"deprecated": true`. While deprecated it is excluded from `graft sync`, `graft agent`, and provider-count summaries, and its skills directory (`.gemini/skills/`) is not managed by `graft skill`. This is distinct from a *planned* provider like antigravity, which has never been active.
